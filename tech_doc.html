      <header>Fundamentals of Fasting</header>
      <p>Muslims observe fasting for a full-30-days fasting during the month of Ramadan which is the ninth month in the Hijri calendar just after Syaban.</p>
      <p>It is a holy period for the Muslims as they will usually potray the goodness in them and the good deeds will naturally be kept at the highest during this period. We can see many Muslims, despite constraining themselves and depriving from food and drinks for the day, they strive to do good by being good muslims as a basis and to the point of helping others in need!</p>
      <p>Indeed this month is truly beautiful and the best time to capture the moments where muslims are basically at their A game. At day, they will fast and they will only break their fast when the sun sets which is during Maghrib. Not only fasting on the day, they will also observe performing prayers called Taraweeh prayers after isyak time and this prayer might last for 2 hours straight.</p>
